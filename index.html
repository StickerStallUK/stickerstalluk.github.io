      UKStickerStall has its origins with Scott Helm, who had the idea to supplement the former SteelCon Charity Bring & Buy table with a large collection of stickers (donated by both vendors and hackers), allowing attendees to obtain stickers in return for charitable donations.
      Over the years, it grew, hit the road, and began appearing at many UK cyber community events.

    <section id="event-organisers">
      <h2>Info for Event Organisers</h2>
      <p>
        Making sure the stickers end up in the right place is managed via the BSidesUK & Eire Organisers Discord server. If you want it, please reach out to someone in there. 
        There is no specific owner of the box, but several volunteers coordinate its travel. 
        There is an expectation that your event will play an active part in collecting it from the previous event, and ensuring it gets to the next one.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike previous iterations of the sticker stall, all we do is help arrange its travel and try to keep it topped up. 
        What you do with it, how much you charge, how you manage donations, Gift Aid, and cash, and who works the stall, is entirely up to you. 
        But remember, it's a community thing, for the good of the whole community. Try to leave it as good as you found it, if not better.
      </p>

      <p>
        We strongly encourage you to solicit new stickers and other swag, both from vendors and other attendees. 
        For non-sticker items, consider whether someone would actually pay for it (avoid bundles of 1,000 lanyards with just a sponsor’s name, for example). 
        Also, avoid anything perishable or messy.

      <h2>Info for Sticker Donators</h2>
      <p>
        We love new stickers, not just from hackers, but from vendors too! 
        Ideally, hand them to whoever is working the stall at a UK event, but if that's not possible, reach out on social media for a postal address. 
        We also usually have volunteers at many major European events and at Hacker Summer Camp (Black Hat, BSides Las Vegas, DefCon) in the US.
