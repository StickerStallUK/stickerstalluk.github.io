    <p>
      UKStickerStall has its origins with Scott Helm, who had the idea to supplement the former SteelCon Charity Bring & Buy table with a large collection of stickers (donated by both vendors and hackers), allowing attendees to obtain stickers in return for charitable donations.
      Over the years, it grew, hit the road, and began appearing at many UK Cyber Community events.

    <p>
      It normally travels with Cooper's AV rigs, and how it’s used—what prices are set, how money is taken, and which charities are supported—is up to the event organisers.
      All we ask is that you let us know how much you raised, so we can highlight the generosity of our community.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to donate stickers, either hand them over to the sticker stall at an event, or contact one of our social media accounts for a postal address.
